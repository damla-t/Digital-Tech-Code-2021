        <h1>AS 91886 (1.10) - Demonstrate understanding of human-computer interaction - 3 Credits</h1>
        <p>With this external, you need to show how computers interact with humans. How humans understand computers, and how Neilsen's Heuristics help humans communicate with computers. </p>

        <p>First, start with understanding Neilsen's Heuristics. There are 10 of them. Find the meaning, and understand what each of them stands for. 
            <br><br>
        1) Visibility of system status <br>
        2) Aesthetic and minimalist design<br>
        3) User control and freedom<br>
        4) Error prevention<br>
        5) Flexibility and efficiency of use<br>
        6) Helps users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors<br>
        7) Match between the system and the real world<br>
        8) Consistency and standards<br>
        9) Help and documentation<br>
        10) Recognition rather than recall
        <br><br>
        All of these Heuristics have a purpose in a website. So use your resources- such as Google to figure out their purpose in a digital outcome. In the exam, you will get to choose a website. It could be your own choice or it could be chosen for you. Your teacher will decide that. You will either have access to the chosen website or you will have a video that shows the function and specifications of the website. You will need to explain its purpose and how people use it (e.g. Google - Search engine helps people access information). Then you will need to identify which Heuristics are used, and if they are effective/how effective is it? Then you need to suggest how some Herusitics can be used.</p>
        
        <p>While you should check past papers and learn here is some things you should include in each paragraph. 
            <br><br>
        a) <br>
        - The role/purpose <br>
        - How do users use this website <br>
        - Any other services provided? <br>
        - Who is the target audience/expected users? <br>
        - Comments about aesthetic <br><br>

        b) (Per Heuristic)<br>
        - Name of the Heuristic<br>
        -How does it help users?<br>
        - Why is it important?<br>
        - Give examples<br><br>
        
        c) <br>
        - What does it do?<br>
        - Why?<br>
        - Example<br>
        - How does it help the user/effectiveness<br>
        - Any improvements/downsides<br><br>

        d)<br>
        - Compare and contrast the two websites. They will usually have a similar purpose so try to do the same things on both (e.g. try to create an account and see their similarities and differences and how each can be improved) </p>
        
        <p>Remember this is not a complete template. I would suggest looking at past papers as well as model answers and trying to see how you would write it. Highlight any important information you would like to add to your answers. If you can choose two websites, and try to sit a mock exam by yourself. Then you can compare your answers to the model answers. <br><br>
        
        Remember to learn ALL Heuristics, as you can't be sure which one you will need. You just need to learn simple definitions. You could create flashcards to help with this process. <br><br>
        
        Also, remember to include lots of screenshots. Illustrate what you are trying to say.  No website/digital outcome is perfect. You can always find weaknesses no matter how small. You can call those weaknesses and give your opinion on how to improve them. <br><br>
        
        Click <a href="https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/assessment/view-detailed.do?standardNumber=91886" title="Click to go to the NCEA Website">here</a> to go to the NCEA website where all the information about this external can be found, including past papers and model answers.<br><br>

        Good Luck!</p>
