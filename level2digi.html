        <h1>AS 91899 (2.10) - Present a summary of developing a digital outcome - 3 Credits</h1>
        <p>This external is very similar to 1.10 the external from last year for Digital Technologies. But this year instead of looking at two different professional websites you look at your website and discuss the decisions you made during your project. You need to talk about the project management tools as well as talking about how you managed your projects, and how you would improve them if you did it again. </p>
        <p>While working on your digital outcome, try to make a list of project management tools you used, how they helped you and if you would do something different. It is good to note down these while they are fresh in your memory so you can look at your notes later in the year, and remember them easily. </p>
        <p>Also, decide on which decisions you want to discuss, for example separating your project into smaller chunks - did that help you? Make it harder for you? Would you separate them into smaller chunks? Bigger? Talk about all the major decisions you have made and reflect on them. </p>
        <p>How has your digital outcome addressed relevant implications and user requirements? </p>
        <p>Reflect. Based on all of the above how would you do things differently? Would you change any of the tools you have used? How would you address things?</p>
        
        <p>Click <a href="https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/assessment/view-detailed.do?standardNumber=91899" title="Click to go to the NCEA Website">here</a> to go to the NCEA website where all the information about this external can be found, including past papers and model answers.</p>
        <p>Good Luck!</p>
