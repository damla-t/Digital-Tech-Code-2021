        <p>Unlike most externals, this external is not an exam. It is a report that you need to write up. </p>
        <p>You need to explain what a good design of your digital outcome would include. For example, in the case of a website you might talk about user Heuristics that would make a daily user communicate better etc., You need to explain the process of explaining a good website compared to a bad website. You might judge a digital outcome depending on sustainability, accessibility, functionality etc. A digital outcome can also be judged by the values and views held by the user. </p>

        <p>Click <a href="https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/assessment/view-detailed.do?standardNumber=91617" title="Click to go to the NCEA Website">here</a> to go to the NCEA website where all the information about this external can be found, including past papers and model answers.</p>
        <p>Good Luck!</p>
