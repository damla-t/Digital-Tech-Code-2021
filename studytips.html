    <h1>Study Tips:</h1>
    <p>1) Set a time to study - I understand that life can be very busy, however, it would be helpful to set a time to study in your calendar. It could also help to plan your day as soon as you wake up and keep to that schedule. </p>

    <p>2) Study at your own pace - No one knows you better than yourself. Take some time to understand how you like to study, and how long it takes you to understand things. Just because you take longer doesn't mean that you are dumb, or you are incapable of understanding that topic. It just means that you have to spend longer studying to understand it. Plan your studying according to yourself. 
    </p>

    <p>3) Don't stay up all night studying - Don't forget to rest. Your brain needs rest and food just as much. Try not to leave all your studying until the last day where you have to study until late. It won't help you the next day, and concepts will be harder to understand. </p>

    <p>4) Remove distractions - Identify what breaks your train of thought, and what distracts you. Try to remove them while you are studying. This could be silencing your phone, or instead of listening to your latest favourite song, just listening to some rain noises. </p>

    <p>5) Choose a good studying spot - Make sure you are not studying on your bed, as your body recognizes your bed as somewhere to rest not somewhere to learn things. If you can't study at home try to go to a library or somewhere quiet where you can study. 
    </p>

    <p>6) Don't forget to snack and drink water - Drink lots of water and snack with some light foods. This could include nuts, small chocolate bars etc. </p>

    <p>7) Summarize your notes - Highlight the most important concepts and re-write your notes as if you were the teacher. Make them so you understand the topic and you can understand it again at a glance rather than having to flip through pages and pages of notes when you are looking for information. </p>

    <p>8) Create Flashcards - Create your flashcards with the important vocabulary. </p>

    <p>9) Break down the information you want to learn - It is easier to remember small chunks of information rather than trying to remember the entire topic at once. So split it into smaller components and understand those chunks.</p>

    <p>10) Take regular breaks and know when to stop - Studying is important but it shouldn't be your life. Know when to take breaks and when to call it a day. You should aim to do about 50 minutes to an hour of studying and then take a 20-minute break. And take one big break at least once every two studying hours. </p>

    <p>11) Take notes in class - It is helpful to listen and take notes in class. Your teacher might mention something that isn't in the notes that might help you. So ensure that you are engaged with your work (I know Buzzfeed is very tempting but try to avoid it) and try to again avoid distractions. </p>

    <p>12) Don't forget to exercise - If you are not athletic you could always go for a walk. If you are athletic, then you can do your favourite sport. Take time to do things you enjoy. </p>

    <h2>Your life shouldn't be just about studying. Try to organize your time so you get a few hours of studying but you also have time to hang out with your friends or try that new recipe you've been wanting to try. Don't forget to do what you love and what you enjoy as well as studying and achieving the grades you are after!</h2>
