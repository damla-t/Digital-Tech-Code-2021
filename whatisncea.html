    <p>NCEA is the national Education System of New Zealand. It is used in many high schools, and other tertiary establishments. During your highschool years you will go through 3 levels of NCEA. Starting from Level 1 in Year 11, in Year 12 you will do Level 2 and in Year 13 Level 3. However for most schools it is possible to do higher level work, just talk to your teachers. <br><br>
        To pass NCEA Level 1 you need 80 credits, to pass Level 2 NCEA, you need 60 credits and to pass NCEA Level 3 you will need 60 credits to pass,gathered through internal and external examniations. These credits will be given to you through Internal and External assesments. Each assesment will be worth a ceratin amount of credits. Internal examniations are done through your school, and are marked internally by your own teachers. External examniations are done at school, generally (this is dependent on your subjects, some subjects do portfolioes and send them the NZQA to be externally marked) at the end of the school year (as part of the end of year examinations) and will be marked by teachers all across New Zealand. <br><br>
        With each internal and external you will recieve a grade. These grades are Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit and Excellence. If you recieve a Not Achieved (NA) grade, it will mean that you will not recieve these credits, as you have failed the assignment. If you recieve Achieved, Merit or Excellence credits, these credits will be recored in your records, which can be accessed, through the NZQA website. <br><br> 
        If you recieve 50 or more Merit or Excellence credits overall in a level you will recieve a Merit of Excellence endorsment. <br><br>
        You will be automatically be part of NCEA as soon as your school send your results in. You can find more information on the NZQA's website. https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/</p>
